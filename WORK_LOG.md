| Sept 24 | 9:50-11:20pm | I'm currently trying to figure out how exactly to implement SpellCheck. During class, I talked with Cody, Clifford, and Liam about an idea, and have taken some time to think about it myself as well: My current idea is to create a ton of objects of possible words. Each object array is of length 26 (for the alphabet) and has a boolean that checks whether the possible word is in the dictionary or if it isn't. Each new object branches off from the prior (each object is made for each cell in the array), like we talked about in the quiz question. From there, it would be a constant time look-up to check the words, since you would index into the array spot for each letter and see whether the object is a word or not. My concerns with this approach is how would you know when to stop creating words? Is there any other way to make it more efficient (using DFS to add only the words in the dictionary to the arrays and the rest would be null so we know it won't be a word)? Would it be insanely slow because we have to traverse through the dictionary to even see if it's a real word? I'm trying to think of alternative ideas, but this is my best shot for now. I spent these 30 minutes brainstorming out on a whiteboard, so I don't have any actual code right now. |
