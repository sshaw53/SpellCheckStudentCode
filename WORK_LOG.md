| Sept 24 | 10:50-11:20pm | I'm currently trying to figure out how exactly to implement SpellCheck. During class, I talked with Cody, Clifford, and Liam about an idea, and have taken some time to think about it myself as well: My current idea is to create a ton of objects of possible words. Each object array is of length 26 (for the alphabet) and has a boolean that checks whether the possible word is in the dictionary or if it isn't. Each new object branches off from the prior (each object is made for each cell in the array), like we talked about in the quiz question. From there, it would be a constant time look-up to check the words, since you would index into the array spot for each letter and see whether the object is a word or not. My concerns with this approach is how would you know when to stop creating words? Is there any other way to make it more efficient (using DFS to add only the words in the dictionary to the arrays and the rest would be null so we know it won't be a word)? Would it be insanely slow because we have to traverse through the dictionary to even see if it's a real word? I'm trying to think of alternative ideas, but this is my best shot for now. I spent these 30 minutes brainstorming out on a whiteboard, so I don't have any actual code right now. |

Now, I am trying to code a map like union-find. The map is the length of the dictionary, where each index refers to the word at the index of that given dictionary. Words alike point to each other, like we did on the quiz problem. There are a ton of different clusters of words in the dictionary, and when you cannot add to a given cluster anymore, you just create a new one. In terms of traversing, I will go through each word, and  through each root to see if the word at the root is the beginning of the word in the text that I am looking at. If so, I will go down the cluster to find if the word is present. I worked on coding this idea, specifically the implementation of the map before checking each word. |

Yet, I was still unable to get it to run successfully even after lots of time and debugging. I also am getting a little lost looking back at my code again so I might take a look at it later if I have time. |

I understand all of the concepts now. My goal now is to figure out how to keep track of misspelled as an array. I'm thinking of making an ArrayList of Strings and add to the list if lookup returns true. Then, I will use the toArr function to return in the correct format. |

I could've created a bounds that restricts the letters that go into the trie or I could make the array next size 256 to cover for all of the ASCII values and wouldn't need to convert every character to fit my size 27 array. Since we're creating TSTs next, I just decided to make my arrays size 256. Now, it works and it's time to code the TST! |

I'm not entirely sure if my process is even correct, I keep having to go back to writing it out, but I'm not sure my approach is right. I've been working on and off on it all day but primarily for the past hour. I'm going to either look over that function again or start trying to code the lookup() function. |
